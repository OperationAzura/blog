      <h2 class="title">Face the Dragon</h2>
      <div class="summary">I have been thinking about dragons a lot lately. Although, probably not what your thinking. Perhaps I should say thinking about archetypal stories. I would attribute a great deal of this to a University of Toronto psychology professor, Jordan B. Peterson. I love his lectures, interviews, and video clips. And I feel like I have reached a greater understanding of myself thanks to this.
Dragon stories come from all over the world, and from all across time.</div>

I woke up late, which is fine with me. But it was after 12, which was when Andre and I were supposed to go for our jog.</div>

I thought I messed up my action cam footage, but nope. So you guys will get to take a look at my little jog. See a garbage truck and some dogs maybe :) I&rsquo;m excited to get going on this action cam. It will have plenty of uses in the near future.</div>

Ironically, I sort of had a bad day. For some reason I could not connect to my raspberry PI. I need to get these Infra Red sensors working.</div>

I took my action cam with me today, but I apparently still do not know how to use it. I thought I had it recording, but sadly I did not. No big deal though, I&rsquo;ll try agian tomorrow.</div>

The run itself was pretty short. I basically went about 1&frasl;3 and then turned around and came back. It was pretty hard to start and keep going, I need that sleep.
I will be trying out my action camera tomorrow, that is a little exciting.</div>

I made a few mistakes though, luckily nothing bad came of it. I forgot to bring my phone and cane. And I did get a little lost / confused. But that is part of this, I need to know where I live.

      <div class="summary">I have been facing a few problems lately. The two main things I need to fix are my acid re-flux, and lack of sleep. So I decided it was time to take action. And I donâ€™t mean go to the doctors office. I find there are usually better ways to solve problems, than taking a pill. A drug generally just replaces, increases, decreases or otherwise modify a humans already existing body chemistry.</div>

      <div class="summary">We had been planning on putting gardens in our back yard for quite a while now. And as of yesterday May 20, 2017, the seeds are planted! But there was a lot of work that had to be done first, considering the areas used to be grass covering up some red clay.
First step was to outline the area of grass to be terra formed. So naturally I had to move Spike&rsquo;s (my robotic lawn mower) base, and his border wire.</div>

I doubled my recipe soo&hellip;
1 cup Coconut flour. Gluten free! Gluten is a wheat protein, and I don&rsquo;t really care about gluten free. But I like coconuts, and trying new things.
