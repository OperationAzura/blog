      <h2 class="title">Terraforming The Back Gardens</h2>
      <div class="summary">We had been planning on putting gardens in our back yard for quite a while now. And as of yesterday May 20, 2017, the seeds are planted! But there was a lot of work that had to be done first, considering the areas used to be grass covering up some red clay.
First step was to outline the area of grass to be terra formed. So naturally I had to move Spike&rsquo;s (my robotic lawn mower) base, and his border wire.</div>

I doubled my recipe soo&hellip;
1 cup Coconut flour. Gluten free! Gluten is a wheat protein, and I don&rsquo;t really care about gluten free. But I like coconuts, and trying new things.
1&frasl;3 cup Coconut sugar. It seems to taste a lot like &ldquo;normal&rdquo; sugar.</div>
