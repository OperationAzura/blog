      <description>What a day! I woke up late, so I could not have my morning cardio. I thought my program was ready, but it still needs work. My meeting with my boss got interrupted about 3 times. But I got an answer.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting up earlier to exercise. This sets me up for a great day. But I slept in, and it all wentcrazy.
I was going to say my program was ready to roll at my normal meeting today.</description>

      <description>I sent a second email in reply to my bosses previous email, before I got a response. This would have spanned about a week. His last email talked about the company loosing money that month. Very far from a clear answer on my request for a pay raise though.
Keep in mind my execution of the request was very poor. I choked, and forgot the parts I had tried to prepare.</description>

      <description>Well we have been watching DBZ lately, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been power up in real life. I&amp;rsquo;ve innitiated my first contract negotiation. I have also started exercising in the early mornings. I just need to keep power up!
This negotiation stuff is not my style. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m doing very well either. But it is my fist time, and if nothing else, its practice. This thing has been dragging out too.</description>

      <description>ell I have been at my job for just over 2 years now. I love it. Though I would love a job that is more specific to my interests. Or to have the ability to pursue other business ideas. Again, I am extremely grateful to my company for hiring me, but I have honestly felt under valued since the beginning. So I attempted to renegotiate my contract, time to start moving forward.</description>

      <title>Terraforming The Back Gardens</title>

      <guid>http://derekspace.ddns.net/project/terraforming-the-back-gardens/</guid>
      <description>We had been planning on putting gardens in our back yard for quite a while now. And as of yesterday May 20, 2017, the seeds are planted! But there was a lot of work that had to be done first, considering the areas used to be grass covering up some red clay.
First step was to outline the area of grass to be terra formed. So naturally I had to move Spike&amp;rsquo;s (my robotic lawn mower) base, and his border wire.</description>

      <description>Well I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting a little bit with amazon prime pantry. Bottom line, some things are a pretty good deal. But I also experimented a bit with what I bought too.
I doubled my recipe soo&amp;hellip;
1 cup Coconut flour. Gluten free! Gluten is a wheat protein, and I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about gluten free. But I like coconuts, and trying new things.
1&amp;frasl;3 cup Coconut sugar. It seems to taste a lot like &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; sugar.</description>

      <description>Well tomorrow I should be going to home depot. I need to pick up a few things for various projects. I nee: PVC pipes and connectors for my solar panel fram electrical junction box that can be nailed to studs, for an outlet or light switch bag of soil
I got measurements for my solar panels, I just need to get the materials now. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into detail here, since I did just a few blogs ago.</description>

      <guid>http://derekspace.ddns.net/project/painting-code/</guid>
      <description>I have been tossing around the idea of trying to paint my programs. I figured it would help me visualize what I&amp;rsquo;m working on better. And just might gain some artistic talent while I am at it. But mostly like Bob Ross says &amp;ldquo;every day is a good day when you paint.&amp;rdquo;
It took me a while to take the leap. I decided I was spending far too much time worrying about how it will look or what to paint.</description>

      <description>A while ago I tore up all the grass along the backside of the house, to make garden space. I also leveled out the dirt a lot. But I was missing a piece on the other side of the steps.
This time around I basically cut strips of sodd out of the grass. I moved them out of the way as gently as possible. I want to keep as much of the top soil as possible.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been stalled on my solar tracking plans for a while now, and its time to get the engine going again. The main thing that stands in my way is building a frame. I have been trying to get other people to help me with this, but so far nobody has been able to give me the help I need.
I am not incredibly adept at physical fabrication. Like welding, cutting, glueing, measuring and etc.</description>

      <description>Our storage room doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a light. And that is annoying. So I plan to install one. I got some parts already but I messed up a little on the order.
What I need in total: Light Fixture &amp;lt; got it Romex House Wire &amp;lt; got it Light Switch Power Box to mount light switch &amp;lt; got the wrong kind.
extra for Raspberry PI projects: A relay &amp;lt; have some, but none that are like proper.</description>

      <guid>http://derekspace.ddns.net/project/fighting-dragons./</guid>
      <description>There are many different ways an artist can create a dragon. But what do all dragons have in common? From the snake like dragons of the East, or the more dinosaur like version of the west? They are the ultimate predator. And it is to be feared, but it can be overcome. And if you defeat that dragon, you will certainly find a worthy prize of some sort.
Dragons do exist, in everyone&amp;rsquo;s lives.</description>

      <description>Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t think my houses gutters have been cleaned in years. And I have yet to be here an entire year. So I figured it was about time to clear them out.
With clear gutters much less water will just spill over the sides. There was a large canal water had cut into the ground right next to my house. I have just filled it up, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want that to continue.</description>

      <description>Well I have been trouble shooting my images issue for a little while now. And I&amp;rsquo;m ready to stick a fork in it for now. But yet agian I think I got it this time.
After the last set of fixes it seems the image was not ready and in place before the hugo command was being run. I added a time.Sleep(500) to see if that will be a temperary fix.</description>

      <description>s. Weagly sent a request to the IT department earlier today. She requested a wired network connection in her office. So I got the IT crew to start work on it immediately.
Alex and I ran a cat5e cable from the existing hole in the floor, in the network center, to the existing hole in Valeries office. Her office had an old faceplate with 2 coax connections and a phone connection, that were all disconnected before we secured this location.</description>

      <description>pike is a Worx Robotic Mower. I have had him for a while now. And I could easily say he is the most useful robot I have ever met. He was expensive, but he saves me a lot of time and money.
I had moved his boundary wire a little a few days ago. To make room for the garden we are planning in our back yard. I figured I could improve his docking reliability.</description>

      <description>I have been thinking about dragons a lot lately. Although, probably not what your thinking. Perhaps I should say thinking about archetypal stories. I would attribute a great deal of this to a University of Toronto psychology professor, Jordan B. Peterson. I love his lectures, interviews, and video clips. And I feel like I have reached a greater understanding of myself thanks to this.
Dragon stories come from all over the world, and from all across time.</description>

      <description>Today has been a pretty good day! I didn&amp;rsquo;t really plan on going for my run, and I sure didn&amp;rsquo;t do it at 7am :) What had happened was, I was talking to my friend Andre and he came over to run with me. It was a great idea!
I woke up late, which is fine with me. But it was after 12, which was when Andre and I were supposed to go for our jog.</description>

      <description>Alrighty! I did get some action cam footage today! I had a pretty good jog, and a pretty good day too. Also my associations have gotten stronger!
I thought I messed up my action cam footage, but nope. So you guys will get to take a look at my little jog. See a garbage truck and some dogs maybe :) I&amp;rsquo;m excited to get going on this action cam. It will have plenty of uses in the near future.</description>

      <description>Today the title is a bit of a lie. I have some satisfactory excuses, but I wish I would have. But my legs are sore and I have been failing at getting enough sleep. So I figured I would benefit from the rest.
Ironically, I sort of had a bad day. For some reason I could not connect to my raspberry PI. I need to get these Infra Red sensors working.</description>

      <description>I made the same mistake agian, didn&amp;rsquo;t get enough sleep. I really need to nip that in the bud. But that is completely doable. The run was pretty good though, even though it didn&amp;rsquo;t go as planned.
I took my action cam with me today, but I apparently still do not know how to use it. I thought I had it recording, but sadly I did not. No big deal though, I&amp;rsquo;ll try agian tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Well today was a bit rough. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get enough sleep and that significantly effected everything basically. Overall I still feel good, I just ned to get that sleep.
The run itself was pretty short. I basically went about 1&amp;frasl;3 and then turned around and came back. It was pretty hard to start and keep going, I need that sleep.
I will be trying out my action camera tomorrow, that is a little exciting.</description>

      <description>This morning I got up at 7:30am and went for a jog. It was hard at first, but after pushing on a bit, it gets much easier. I made a few mistakes though, luckily nothing bad came of it. I forgot to bring my phone and cane. And I did get a little lost / confused. But that is part of this, I need to know where I live. I just need to bring a fully charged phone, and my new collapsible white cane, just in case.</description>

      <description>I have been facing a few problems lately. The two main things I need to fix are my acid re-flux, and lack of sleep. So I decided it was time to take action. And I don’t mean go to the doctors office. I find there are usually better ways to solve problems, than taking a pill. A drug generally just replaces, increases, decreases or otherwise modify a humans already existing body chemistry.</description>

      <description>I’ve been puppy sitting Lucy, my brothers dog, for a couple days now. And I decided to take her for a walk and do a little bit of exploring. I am going to start running in the mornings, so I needed to scope out my route.
Still a puppy, Lucy isn’t very “good” at going for a walk. She wants to run, and smell, and all sorts of things. So it takes a good bit of effort to keep her on a short leash and keep her walking “with” me.</description>

      <title>Java Tutorial 2: Think In Loops</title>
      <link>http://derekspace.ddns.net/project/thinkinloops/</link>

      <description>Loops are a workhorse of all programming languagses. And most have an extremely similar syntax.
Lets just start from the most basic. The IF statement. The if statement will check aa condition, and if that condition is true, it will execute the code within the if statement.
if (1 &amp;gt; 2){ System.out.println(&amp;ldquo;1 is never greater than 2&amp;rdquo;); }
Nice! Well what do you want to do if that if check is false?</description>

      <description>Lets dive right in!
To star we must first set up our development enviroment. This ranges from basic text editors, to Integrated Development Enviroments, IDE&amp;rsquo;s. We Will be setting up NetBeans, and IDE designed with Java in mind.
First step is downloading the software
Go here and download NetBeans and JDK 8, then select your operating system. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
Once the download is finished open it. Complete the install, it may take a while.</description>
