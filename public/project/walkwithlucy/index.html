        <div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I’ve been puppy sitting Lucy, my brothers dog, for a couple days now.  And I decided to take her for a walk and do a little bit of exploring.  I am going to start running in the mornings, so I needed to scope out my route.</p>

<p>Still a puppy, Lucy isn’t very “good” at going for a walk.  She wants to run, and smell, and all sorts of things.  So it takes a good bit of effort to keep her on a short leash and keep her walking “with” me.  Which was the spark that ignited an adventure.</p>

<p>We started our walk, taking a route I’ve gone before, that would basically just take me around the block.  But I decided to go explore down this one road.  It lead me to a main road, so I just turned around and was going to go back the way I came.  But Lucy and I missed our turn.</p>

<p>There were so many exciting things to smell and other dogs who wanted to talk to Lucy, I completely missed my turn.  And when I realized this I took out my phone.  And there it was, starring right at me… 2% battery!  Quite the “OH SHIT” moment for me.  Had my phone been charged, I would have just asked google to navigate home, piece of cake.</p>

<p>So I just turned around and started walking down the streets I thought could be my turn.  This idea would have worked just fine, but it was getting dark.  In fact I probably turned onto my street and turned back around deciding it was not the way I came, which it wasn’t.</p>

<p>After doing this 3 times, it was getting dark.  To top it off, I had worn my good moccasins by accident.  These things are not great walking shoes.  By now I was getting concerned, this wasn’t the little adventure I had planned.  But I just kept going.  I knew I wasn’t very far from where I wanted to be.</p>

<p>On the fourth road I turned into to check, I was starting to loose confidence.  I was thinking about how I would get some help.  Walk up to a house, or maybe wave at a car.  Yikes!  But I was finally where I wanted to be, even though I did not know that for sure.</p>

<p>As I was trying to find the road I needed to turn onto, while considering what house might be the best to try and approach, Lucy started trying to lead.  After I thought about it for a second, if I was in the right place she may very well know were to go.  She wanted to turn down a road, one that I was hoping was the road I wanted.  She seemed pretty sure of herself, so I let her lead.</p>

<p>After just a minute, I could tell were we were.  It was the road I had hoped.  The short little stretch of road right before we turn into my road.  As we got a bit closer I could see my solar lights by the driveway.  And the adventure was over.  And wow I love Lucy!</p>

<p>We gained some good x on this adventure.  I have a better mental map of my neighborhood.  Lucy got some practice walking “with” me, instead of doing her own thing.  AND she helped me find my way back in the dark.</p>

<p>One thing this adventure illustrates is my ability to function in the unknown.  This is a concept I have thought about off and on.  My life is full of the unknown.  And I am forced to deal with this every day.  Imagine how well things would have gone if I had panicked or got upset.  And the “unknown” is naturally a scary thing for all animals.  Successfully dealing with the unknown is a very rewarding ability.  One that is a requirement for my life.</p>

<p>The lessons learned are pretty simple though.  Make sure my phone is charged!  All of my problems would have been solved by having a charged phone.  Also I should have a battery pack and always bring my cane.</p>

      <div class="summary">What a day! I woke up late, so I could not have my morning cardio. I thought my program was ready, but it still needs work. My meeting with my boss got interrupted about 3 times. But I got an answer.
I&rsquo;ve been getting up earlier to exercise. This sets me up for a great day. But I slept in, and it all wentcrazy.
I was going to say my program was ready to roll at my normal meeting today.</div>

      <div class="summary">I sent a second email in reply to my bosses previous email, before I got a response. This would have spanned about a week. His last email talked about the company loosing money that month. Very far from a clear answer on my request for a pay raise though.
Keep in mind my execution of the request was very poor. I choked, and forgot the parts I had tried to prepare.</div>

      <div class="summary">Well we have been watching DBZ lately, but I&rsquo;ve been power up in real life. I&rsquo;ve innitiated my first contract negotiation. I have also started exercising in the early mornings. I just need to keep power up!
This negotiation stuff is not my style. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m doing very well either. But it is my fist time, and if nothing else, its practice. This thing has been dragging out too.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Contract Negotiation</h2>
      <div class="summary">ell I have been at my job for just over 2 years now. I love it. Though I would love a job that is more specific to my interests. Or to have the ability to pursue other business ideas. Again, I am extremely grateful to my company for hiring me, but I have honestly felt under valued since the beginning. So I attempted to renegotiate my contract, time to start moving forward.</div>
