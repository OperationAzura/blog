      <description>s. Weagly sent a request to the IT department earlier today. She requested a wired network connection in her office. So I got the IT crew to start work on it immediately.
Alex and I ran a cat5e cable from the existing hole in the floor, in the network center, to the existing hole in Valeries office. Her office had an old faceplate with 2 coax connections and a phone connection, that were all disconnected before we secured this location.</description>
