      <description>What a day! I woke up late, so I could not have my morning cardio. I thought my program was ready, but it still needs work. My meeting with my boss got interrupted about 3 times. But I got an answer.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting up earlier to exercise. This sets me up for a great day. But I slept in, and it all wentcrazy.
I was going to say my program was ready to roll at my normal meeting today.</description>

      <description>ell I have been at my job for just over 2 years now. I love it. Though I would love a job that is more specific to my interests. Or to have the ability to pursue other business ideas. Again, I am extremely grateful to my company for hiring me, but I have honestly felt under valued since the beginning. So I attempted to renegotiate my contract, time to start moving forward.</description>
