      <description>I sent a second email in reply to my bosses previous email, before I got a response. This would have spanned about a week. His last email talked about the company loosing money that month. Very far from a clear answer on my request for a pay raise though.
Keep in mind my execution of the request was very poor. I choked, and forgot the parts I had tried to prepare.</description>

      <description>Well we have been watching DBZ lately, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been power up in real life. I&amp;rsquo;ve innitiated my first contract negotiation. I have also started exercising in the early mornings. I just need to keep power up!
This negotiation stuff is not my style. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m doing very well either. But it is my fist time, and if nothing else, its practice. This thing has been dragging out too.</description>
