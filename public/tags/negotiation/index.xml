      <description>What a day! I woke up late, so I could not have my morning cardio. I thought my program was ready, but it still needs work. My meeting with my boss got interrupted about 3 times. But I got an answer.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting up earlier to exercise. This sets me up for a great day. But I slept in, and it all wentcrazy.
I was going to say my program was ready to roll at my normal meeting today.</description>

      <description>I sent a second email in reply to my bosses previous email, before I got a response. This would have spanned about a week. His last email talked about the company loosing money that month. Very far from a clear answer on my request for a pay raise though.
Keep in mind my execution of the request was very poor. I choked, and forgot the parts I had tried to prepare.</description>
