      <description>We had been planning on putting gardens in our back yard for quite a while now. And as of yesterday May 20, 2017, the seeds are planted! But there was a lot of work that had to be done first, considering the areas used to be grass covering up some red clay.
First step was to outline the area of grass to be terra formed. So naturally I had to move Spike&amp;rsquo;s (my robotic lawn mower) base, and his border wire.</description>

      <description>A while ago I tore up all the grass along the backside of the house, to make garden space. I also leveled out the dirt a lot. But I was missing a piece on the other side of the steps.
This time around I basically cut strips of sodd out of the grass. I moved them out of the way as gently as possible. I want to keep as much of the top soil as possible.</description>
