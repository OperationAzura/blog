      <description>pike is a Worx Robotic Mower. I have had him for a while now. And I could easily say he is the most useful robot I have ever met. He was expensive, but he saves me a lot of time and money.
I had moved his boundary wire a little a few days ago. To make room for the garden we are planning in our back yard. I figured I could improve his docking reliability.</description>
