Today has been a pretty good day!  I didn't really plan on going for my run, and I sure didn't do it at 7am :)  What had happened was, I was talking to my friend Andre and he came over to run with me. It was a great idea!

I woke up late, which is fine with me.  But it was after 12, which was when Andre and I were supposed to go for our jog.  But that was fine, he was off doing his thing.  One of which was upgrading his PS4 hard drive, and he needed to borrow a computer to get a file to update his new system.  I was happy to oblige. 

 After that, and a bit of chit chat, Andre and I stretched and got going.  It is a nice thing to be able to keep pace with someone while running.  And Andre being in a bit better shape than me, I had to push myself a bit.  I love to push myself, it is why I know my body so well.  Push it to the limit!  Walk along the razor's edge!  Anyhow we did two laps.  I doubled my run, and I feel great.

Running is an awesome thing.  Aside from all the more obvious benefits, it is very peaceful.  Just you and the road, just focus on running, and let the rest of your mind wander.  I would consider it a form of meditation even.

I have been feeling pretty good today.  But I also have had several cups of coffee.  I just wanted coffee.  No big deal though, today is not a routine day.  And I need to get some stuff done!  Like the video for the last few days >.<
