What a day!  I woke up late, so I could not have my morning cardio.  I thought my program was ready, but it still needs work.  My meeting with my boss got interrupted about 3 times.  But I got an answer.

I've been getting up earlier to exercise.  This sets me up for a great day.  But I slept in, and it all wentcrazy.

I was going to say my program was ready to roll at my normal meeting today.  But just before, I was helping my coworker debug an issue, and showing off my program at the same time.  And we found a few things needed to be added.  So thats not bad, but its a mixed bag.

My meeting with my boss got cut short about 2 minutes into the conversation.  He lost signal as he had to leave the office, bike home, and go to the doctors.  The next conversation was started around 4 in the afternoon.  And was cut short by his microphone glitching out.  A while later, we finally got to talking.

Short answer, not yet.  Basically the company is going through a rough patch, and can't afford to do  anything right now.  It was explained to me in enough detail, so I assume that is actually the case.  The amount I asked for is too much, and he said he will get me a pay range estimate in a week or so, so I will have an idea of what to expect when the finances are all smileys and flowers.  I will probably try to keep informed on the company finances from now on.  But I expect to try again in a matter of months.

So not exactly what I wanted to hear, but good enough.  I got closure on the subject, and got to chit chat a bit.  I will be selectively shopping around for jobs for a while.  If I don't get what I need in a year, I will start taking the job hunt more seriously.  But for now, look for jobs I really want, and just keep on trucking.
