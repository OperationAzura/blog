A while ago I tore up all the grass along the backside of the house, to make garden space.  I also leveled out the dirt a lot.  But I was missing a piece on the other side of the steps.

This time around I basically cut strips of sodd out of the grass.  I moved them out of the way as gently as possible.  I want to keep as much of the top soil as possible.  When I was about half done, I got the the slope.

Instead of continuing on cutting the grass and moving it, I decided to just aerate the grass.  Then I threw the sodd ontop, to build the area up to the same level as where I removed the sod.  I was making good progress and then started noticing I was making a pretty steep slope.  I figured it would just wash away if I don't do anything about that.

So I whent and grabbed a board from by the shed.  It made a nice little wall to help hold in the soil.  We shall see how that fares, since it should be raining a lot in the next few days.
