Today the title is a bit of a lie.  I have some satisfactory excuses, but I wish I would have. But my legs are sore and I have been failing at getting enough sleep.  So I figured I would benefit from the rest.

Ironically, I sort of had a bad day.  For some reason I could not connect to my raspberry PI.  I need to get these Infra Red sensors working.  I can use them as light switches AND to controll my stero from the net.  And I lost 1 of my SD cards.  So I feel like I had a bad day because I didn't jog.  So that is a good association to have.  If I don't run, I will have a bad day.

Anyhow, as long as I run tomorrow, its all good.  I'm still excited to get this action cam footage.  So Hopefully we will see that tomorrow.
