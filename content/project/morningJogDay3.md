I made the same mistake agian, didn't get enough sleep.  I really need to nip that in the bud.  But that is completely doable.  The run was pretty good though, even though it didn't go as planned.

I took my action cam with me today, but I apparently still do not know how to use it.  I thought I had it recording, but sadly I did not.  No big deal though, I'll try agian tomorrow.  And I do not expect much will change from day to day, but we shall see.  I'm still excited about the action cam, I'm just not sure whats up with it.  It may not have been charged, but I left it on the charger all night.  I don't know, we shall see.

It was my first complete lap today.  I feel pretty good about it.  It is a pretty good distance to start out with, but once I get back into shape I will need to do laps pretty quickly.

I ended up drinking a cup of coffee as well as a cup of tea today.  I will be going to bed at 11 tonight, that should fix my problem I hope.

Winning! :)
