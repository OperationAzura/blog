So I've been stalled on my solar tracking plans for a while now, and its time to get the engine going again.  The main thing that stands in my way is building a frame.  I have been trying to get other people to help me with this, but so far nobody has been able to give me the help I need.

I am not incredibly adept at physical fabrication.  Like welding, cutting, glueing, measuring and etc.  That being the main reason I have not given up and just tried something myself just yet.  So I am going to try the simplest idea that I think will work, and be legitimately sturdy, PVC.

I will see about getting measurements tomorrow.  The basic idea will be just getting the PVC pipes and the various pipe fittings I need to essentially make a digital clock's 8.  That should be easy enough with a smaller sized PVC pipe.  

I need the frame to be able to hold up to possible significant stress from wind.  i need to be able to mount a motor on it so the it can move the panel to track the sun. I would also like it to be as light as possible.
