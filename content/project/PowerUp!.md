Well we have been watching DBZ lately, but I've been power up in real life.  I've innitiated my first contract negotiation.  I have also started exercising in the early mornings.  I just need to keep power up!

This negotiation stuff is not my style.  I'm not sure I'm doing very well either.  But it is my fist time, and if nothing else, its practice.  This thing has been dragging out too.  I started it like 2 weeks ago, and I just got my boss saying we can talk tomoorrow.  ARG, my social akwardness is why it is important I do this.  Strengthen my weaknesses and all that.

I hadn't been working out much for the past few weeks.  I put an end to that, and then some.  I just started doing exercises in the mornings, and getting up earlier.  This really setts up my day to be a great day.  It gets the oxegen flowing to my brain, gives me some nice nuero chemicals and wakes me up.  I do feel good all day, and I know I perform my job better.

So tomorrow will be another great da, I hope.  I will be showing off my uick books program at work, and after that I'll talk to my boss.  If everything goes well, which it ddn't last tiime.  But it doesn't matter.  I will get up, exercise and make the best of my day
