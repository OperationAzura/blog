I have been facing a few problems lately. The two main things I need to fix are my acid re-flux, and lack of sleep. So I decided it was time to take action. And I don’t mean go to the doctors office. I find there are usually better ways to solve problems, than taking a pill. A drug generally just replaces, increases, decreases or otherwise modify a humans already existing body chemistry. So figuring out how to reach the correct balance is really the key. I have been drinking lots of matcha green tea, and coffee lately. While I enjoy their effects, I think reducing my caffeine intake, especially hot brewed coffee, may go a long a way to reduce my stomach acid. Certainly there are other factors as well. Like stress or diet. But I have to start somewhere. I have also been having issues getting enough sleep. Which is a large driving factor in how much caffeine I consume. But sleep has been a troublesome thing for me. I can remember being 5 years old, and laying awake in bed, while everyone else was asleep. This would be a regular occurrence for me, I had no idea it was even a real problem.
So today I started going to sleep “early”, and waking up early to go for a jog. The idea behind this is kind of multi teared.
Exercising in the morning will wake me up. It will get some happy chemicals flowing, and give me energy for the entire day. This will reduce my reliance on caffeine. As well as the immense benefits of excising. Improved health and happiness, and less stress. So far I would say it has been rather successful.
