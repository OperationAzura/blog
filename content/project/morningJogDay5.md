Alrighty!  I did get some action cam footage today!  I had a pretty good jog, and a pretty good day too.  Also my associations have gotten stronger!

I thought I messed up my action cam footage, but nope.  So you guys will get to take a look at my little jog.  See a garbage truck and some dogs maybe :)  I'm excited to get going on this action cam.  It will have plenty of uses in the near future.

The jog went pretty smoothly.  I still had to take a little breather at significantly past the halfway mark.  But it felt good, and I feel great!  I did get a bit more sleep too, still not really good enough though, just better.

Yesterday I didn't run, and I felt like I had a bad day.  Today I did run, and it was a great day.  So I have the association that if I do not run, I will have a bad day.  And today that is further solidified by running, and having a good day.  Overall it doesn't really mean anything, but it reinforces my confirmation bias.  And in this case it is only a good thing.

I haven't decided for sure if I will keep running next week.  It is getting colder agian, I may opt to do something inside.  I would likely workout on my total gym if I do not run.  But we shall see.

That action cam footage has caused a hold up.  It was recorder at a rather high quality. And I could not stabilize shaking video with my current setup, although youtube can do it for you.  In fact as I type, I am using VideoPad to stabilize the image, and youtube is working on that too.  I had uploaded the unedited video to youtube, incase I had to rely on their image stabilization, then I would just download it again when it is done.  But its not likely I will do it that way a again..  I think VideoPad might be the perfect mix of simple, and robust.  AND the price is right... FREE.
