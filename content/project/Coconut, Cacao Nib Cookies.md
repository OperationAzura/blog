Well I've been experimenting a little bit with amazon prime pantry.  Bottom line, some things are a pretty good deal.  But I also experimented a bit with what I bought too.

I doubled my recipe soo...

1 cup Coconut flour. Gluten free!  Gluten is a wheat protein, and I don't really care about gluten free.  But I like coconuts, and trying new things.

1/3 cup Coconut sugar.  It seems to taste a lot like "normal" sugar. Don't really know if it is any better for you, but I like coconuts... and trying new things :)

1/3 cup Dark Brown Sugar.  Its the same as light brown, just more molasses. So a little bit more flavour.

1/2 teaspoon salt.  I just used salt.

1/2 teaspoon baking soda. I had plenty standing at the ready.

6 eggs Chicken eggs is what I used

Optional: add 1/4 - 1/2 cup almond milk for moisture.

2 teaspoons vanilla!

2/3 cup butter 

4 ounces Raw Cacao Nibs sweetened, but we added some extra chocolate m&m's, And I wish I added more.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 
Mix dry ingredients together in a bowl.
Stir in the wet ingredients, mix well.
Place cookies on parchment paper, on a cookie sheet.  Ball them up, then press them down may give best results.
Bake for 15 - 17 minutes.
Remove cookies, place on wax paper, on your countertop, to cool.
And I bet you will have at least 1 more load, we had 2 1/2 batches.

Overall they are delicious.  They are kind of fluffy.  Kind of dry.  I would have to say I think I prefer wheat flour, I think it is less course.  But certainly a victory, and a wonderful treat for someone with gluten allergies, or hipster glasses. 

Cacao nibs are great.  They are sort of like adark chocolate nut, or seed.  They are expensive though, and I think I could eat a lot.  I am very chocoholic.

My butter wasn't measured well, and it may have been kind of dry.  If I was to make these agian I would add more butter, or take it one more step veggie and use almond butter or maybe coconut oil :)
