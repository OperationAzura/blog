Well today was a bit rough.  I didn't get enough sleep and that significantly effected everything basically.  Overall I still feel good, I just ned to get that sleep.

The run itself was pretty short.  I basically went about 1/3 and then turned around and came back.  It was pretty hard to start and keep going, I need that sleep.

I will be trying out my action camera tomorrow, that is a little exciting.  But I need to figure that camera out, and get some sleep!
