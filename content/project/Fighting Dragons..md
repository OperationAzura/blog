There are many different ways an artist can create a dragon.  But what do all dragons have in common?  From the snake like dragons of the East, or the more dinosaur like version of the west?  They are the ultimate predator.  And it is to be feared, but it can be overcome.  And if you defeat that dragon, you will certainly find a worthy prize of some sort.

Dragons do exist, in everyone's lives. They are the things one fears the most.  The things people think about for far too long.  They may even make one's heart pound or keep them up at night. But do you know what all of those dragons have in common?  You can put on your armour, and take your medieval weapon of choice, and those dragons can be overcome.

Overcoming adversity is what humans do.  That is why we have the internet, and aren't starving in a cave, because we overcame our dragons as a species.  And when someone can overcome a dragons their lives become richer.  

But what happens if you don't face your dragons, if you hide like a scared rabbit?  The dragon will eat you.  It will tear you apart, and everyone around you.  

A dragon only exists to serve you.  Face the damn dragons! Crush them and take the treasure!
