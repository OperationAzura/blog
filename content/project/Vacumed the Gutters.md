Well, I don't think my houses gutters have been cleaned in years.  And I have yet to be here an entire year.  So I figured it was about time to clear them out.

With clear gutters much less water will just spill over the sides.  There was a large canal water had cut into the ground right next to my house.  I have just filled it up, and I don't want that to continue.  I also suspect it may have something to do with my basement floodings.  It should rain in two days, we shall see.

The attachment was just an extension with a hooked piece for the end and a bit of a nozzle.  It works great.  My gutters being so clogged with junk, I had to remove the nozzle.  And it sucks!  It sucks real good :)

I got some good footage and a few pictures that I will do something with sooner or later.  I cleared the entire back gutters.  My arms a bit tired and I'm dirty.  But I feel good!
