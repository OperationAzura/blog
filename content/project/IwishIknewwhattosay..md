I sent a second email in reply to my bosses previous email, before I got a response.  This would have spanned about a week.  His last email talked about the company loosing money that month.  Very far from a clear answer on my request for a pay raise though.  

Keep in mind my execution of the request was very poor.  I choked, and forgot the parts I had tried to prepare.I let my anxiety slow me down.  And it is up to me to make sure that doesn't happen again.  I like my boss.  I would even say he is funny.  I just never really have a chance to socialize with any of my coworkers, and that just compounded with other stressers...

At one point I said "lets cut to the chase."  He replied, "if you want to cut to the chase go to Nathan."  Maybe that is a good idea.  I have literally never said a word to him.  I don't really know what to say though.  Maybe I will tell him about my dreams of starting a ice cream factory.

But more immediately, tomorrows meetings.  I need to be convincing about my quick books integration.  All that remains to be done is the User Interface.  Then I will talk to Blake about a pay raise.  I think I will start with a question. I will say, "you mentioned cv3 finance issues, how serious is it? Is loosing money the exception or the rule? Because whatever the challenge, their is always a way to win.  And I will do everything I can to help CV3 win"

I think If I can get those words out, this could go well.  There is so much uncertainty though.  If CV3 is in trouble, I could ask for stock in the company.  Or maybe it was just a bad month, or maybe just a stalling tactic.  Anyway, if I had let it go, he certainly would not protest.  I have to assert myself to get what I see as proper compensation for my work.
