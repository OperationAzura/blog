s. Weagly sent a request to the IT department earlier today.  She requested a wired network connection in her office.  So I got the IT crew to start work on it immediately.

Alex and I ran a cat5e cable from the existing hole in the floor, in the network center, to the existing hole in Valeries office.  Her office had an old faceplate with 2 coax connections and a phone connection, that were all disconnected before we secured this location.  But that made it easy to bring the wire into the existing wall hole.

We had to stop there for the day.  

TODO:
1. Secure the wire to the basement ceiling, using the hammer and hooks in the basement.
2. Connect the rj45 female ends to each end of the cable.
3. Connect the rj45 female module to the faceplate.
4. Connect the new faceplace, covering up the 2 extra holes.

TODO2:
We may need another wired switch.  The router in the network center is getting full.
