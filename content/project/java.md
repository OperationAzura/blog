Lets dive right in!

To star we must first set up our development enviroment.  This ranges from basic text editors, to Integrated Development Enviroments, IDE's.  We Will be setting up NetBeans, and IDE designed with Java in mind.

First step is downloading the software

Go here and download NetBeans and JDK 8, then select your operating system.
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Once the download is finished open it. Complete the install, it may take a while.  You may choose to opt out of the data-collection system at the end.

Once the installation is complete, just open NetBeans IDE from your start menu. Once it opens click New Project. Now select JAVA and JAVA Application. Click next then name your project. Also uncheck "create main", then click finish.

Place your cursor under the like that says public class helloo, assuming you named your class hello.

Now navigate to your new project on the left, open "Source Packages" then right click > new > Java Package, name your package then click finish.

Now open your new package and right click > new > Java Class, name your class and finish.

Now open youyr new class file, it is time to begin coding.

We will start with a classic, hellow world program.

Place your cursor under the like that says public class helloo, assuming you named your class hello.

We need to creat the main function.  Type "public static void main(String[] args){, then hit enter.  Next type "System.out.println("Hello Butts")

It should look like this:
    public static void main(String[] arg){
        System.out.println("Hello butts");
    }

Now save your file and run it by clicking the green arrow, or the Run menu > run project.

You should see the console pop up displaying your text.

And here the video I made!  Happy programming!
