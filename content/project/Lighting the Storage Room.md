Our storage room doesn't have a light.  And that is annoying.  So I plan to install one.  I got some parts already but I messed up a little on the order.

What I need in total:
Light Fixture < got it
Romex House Wire < got it
Light Switch 
Power Box to mount light switch < got the wrong kind.

extra for Raspberry PI projects:
A relay < have some, but none that are like proper.
IR or ultra sonic sensor < have them but requires testing

But I think first I will just install the light with the switch and a normally open relay for furture use.
