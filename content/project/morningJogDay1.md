This morning I got up at 7:30am and went for a jog.  It was hard at first, but after pushing on a bit, it gets much easier.  I made a few mistakes though, luckily nothing bad came of it.  I forgot to bring my phone and cane.  And I did get a little lost / confused.  But that is part of this, I need to know where I live.  I just need to bring a fully charged phone, and my new collapsible white cane, just in case.
After returning home, I was a bit sore and physically tired.  But it did exactly what I wanted it to do.  I had good energy levels all day.  I only drank 1 cup of matcha tea.  And I'm happy and feel great.  I plan on doing this for at least a week, then maybe make some changes, but maybe not.
I also want to try and encourage others to make positive changes.  Sure it can be "hard", but once you face the dragon, you will get treasure. Or more directly, once it becomes a habit, its much easier, and many rewards will come from it.

If I can do it, so can you!
