Well tomorrow I should be going to home depot.  I need to pick up a few things for various projects.
I nee:
PVC pipes and connectors for my solar panel fram
electrical junction box that can be nailed to studs, for an outlet or light switch
bag of soil

I got measurements for my solar panels, I just need to get the materials now.  I won't go into detail here, since I did just a few blogs ago.

As far as the junction box, I brain farted, I needed two but bought one.  I will be installing a ceiling light in the storage room.  And if I am doing all that work I should go ahead and install an outlet too right?  All I need is 1 more junction box, that can be nailed to studs.  I specify that because the first one I bought could not, and I was unaware of this.

Buy dirt?  Yea maybe.  We were planning on getting some from this garden / landscape suppy place nearby.  But we do not have access to a truck now.  I do not want to keep waiting, we need to plant out plants.  I think it would be fine to just buy a bag of dirt, though the truckload of compost would be cheaper and better possibly.
